  <h3>Sigh</h3>
  <p>Welcome to the new wild west. It will be fun taming this beast. I've already learned so much working with my custom Endpoint Detection and Remediation software that I now believe everyone who wants to know computers and software should do some security monitoring. It is a real eye opener. I call it the secret life of my computer.</p>
  <p>I'm focused on Windows 10 because that is what I'm using but will be picking up more systems as time moves forward. I got more and more into open source using Python which is another point in it's favor and now I'm completely sold. Using Open Source which has a Linux attitude can help you transition to Linux flavored OS's because it opens up the Linux way of doing things.</p>
  <p>I've worked with FreeBSD in the past and will again soon and I will also be picking up a Debain flavor at some point soon so I will be able to run my endpoint auditing on those systems and start picking up some data. I have not moved into the phase of locking my system down by suspending or stopping any processes but I'm getting closer to the day but need more hardware etc. I've been avoiding it as it as setting up machines is such busy work. Here is where I'll post my most relevant findings and start working on what the heck to do about security in the short term. Long term I will be moving to FreeBSD and Linux and customizing for security from there to create a professional VM hosting secure OS to run insecure OS's in. I don't see any other way to be secure long term and still work with customer software which is the target.</p>
