  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>A long long time ago in a galaxy you know and love I started programming in Visual Basic on Windows 95 or was it Windows 3.11? Anyway after selling a few computers I got a job working for the local behemoth Microsoft and like a fly in a comfortable spider web it sort of stuck. I quickly moved on to C and C++ and specialized in USB early on. I kept getting job after job there even though I applied elsewhere. I started in the PC group working with USB before it was released and always enjoyed working in the overlap of software and hardware so I ended up with Xbox a few times as well as the Surface group. I have been full time twice and contacted more then a few times over the years. Always moving on as they like me for testing but I like me for development so it was easy to slip back into but always a mistake, hence the restless career as I've always been deeply committed to being a developer, the very reason I got into the business. I've learned my lesson now, no more test jobs. My test philosophy just isn't compatible anymore with yesterdays test methodologies.</p>
  <p>I've got very comfortable with my own software tools and ways of doing things that have greatly simplified and continue to simplify my process. Both my full time positions there were test and I left to pursue development. Most contracts there were development and when they ended I worked on my own development building equity for the day I get my startup going which finally happened this year. I believe what made me unattractive as an employee will work for me in my own business and that is my tenacity and will to do things my own way knowing that my way is better and more productive for me then any other way. This has proven itself to me in many ways over the last few years and this is where I hope to show the world. But as I said I'm a big picture person and my real important works are still in major development and won't be published for a few years at best but I look forward to the day my technologies are ready and I'm where I want to be on this.</p>
  <p> In the last decade I have developed many pieces of software on my own but mostly for learning. In the last couple of years I have worked harder then ever and I'm in a new phase where the exploration is over and I'm producing the tools and the technologies that I need to support my vision of future development. I am creating a monster that is a system within a system to bring all my tools and solutions together under one IS/Repository roof. I am really good at the top down big picture and coming up with really good ideas. It's the non technical and business details that I am mastering now as well as honing down to the specific offering that I'm most qualified for.</p>
  <p>The future is software, the future is AI and robotics. The future is now. The new developer is everyone as it is all about what skill you bring to the table once again only now you can do it bigger, better, cheaper and faster with software. This is the driving force behind If Now Code. It is really a call to everyone, to evangelize the new opportunities that have opened up for non professional developers as it is maturing even to the level of no code software. Software doesn't need to be released to enhance life or create value. Now with programming languages like Python and programming-less development coming of age this is everyone's game now! This is the new gold rush and information is the new gold. As information is numbers in the digital age you can literally make money out of thin air. With AI it's anyone's game. The future is up for the taking.</p>
  <p>My philosophy is test first and automate always, that is unless you like doing busy repetitive mind numbing labor. Automation is a mind set that pushes everything you do to be automated if possible and be ready for automation when not possible. My test first attitude is really bending toward AI as self diagnostics is just part of what life does so the separation makes no sense to me as programming is just evolution and life, not "applications" which is a very narrow mind set. With programming evolution has gone into overdrive so much so we worry about a singularity. I think it would be nice if it could self test. Maybe it could figure out right from wrong?</p>
  <p>On a final note I must say the GitHub experience was top notch and has given me some great ideas. Kudos to all for a job well done.</p>
