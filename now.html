    <h3>1:22 AM Sunday, May 01, 2022</h3>
    <p>I have been looking through job listings on Indeed and RemoteHub and once again after almost 30 years in the computer industry, with many languages and technologies, I don't qualify for a single job listing in a never ending list of job openings. The required skills for these jobs leaves me wondering statistically if anyone ever actually qualifies for a single job. Since that seems to be the case and no one seems interested in training or ramp up time, they just need them to hit the ground running and take over like I keep hearing then there really needs to be more filter options so I can filter on my resume and find the one job I'm actually semi close to qualifying for. I feel like part of the work force issue is job postings requiring a fantasy list of qualifications and an attitude so positive that a psychiatrist would prescribe you drugs. I have always let recruiters come to me because of this issue. I can't filter enough to find the jobs but recruiters do this for a living which is what I need. Someone on this task full time trying to find the one job that I actually qualify for. Someone who is as highly skilled as myself should not struggle this much to find work in a functioning society. Technology is more omnipresent then ever but technology jobs are only getting more demanding and perfunctory with less opportunity to work with real impact.</p>
    <p>When I first learned computer languages I naively thought that it would be everywhere so I will always find good work. Now it turns out you need a laundry list of specific skills and experience that change more rapidly over time then is possible to learn. I learned the hot languages and that doesn't matter, C/C++, C#, Java, Python are just the ones I've used the most. I know Python but I'm  beginning in Flask and Django and I don't see any other jobs out there for Python yet. I've been doing the bulk of my programming in Python these last couple of years and am enjoying it. Most jobs are web and mobile so forget normal applications development and this is years behind traditional application development and a quickly moving target. I'm just starting with Android Studio, Kotlin and using Java on this platform as a release vector for games and I've been doing full stack work that past few years with HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL/MariaDB, Apache, Perl, Python and more for business back end work. The job market moves faster then the speed of education which is a real issue so I won't have the years of experience in one of the languages required or a skill in one of the technologies required. I can guarantee you that I never fully qualified for the jobs I was hired for and was successful at. You need to walk on water as they say to be average now a days if you believe what you read. When I get to the point of needing to hire I will definitely take a long hard look at this process.</p>
    <p>I will continue to look for work and not just wait for recruiters to ping me. I'm not liking the waiting anymore but to match me up with people who want my services I'm going to need more then this one size fits all societal approach that I fondly refer to as one size fits nothing. I am set up for c2c but will also work w2. I'm up for another round of cash infusion into my startup which I have been financing myself working w2 contracts. Without proper partnerships getting a startup off of the ground is difficult but I'm a very strong willed and independent person so I have been learning it all and following my instincts which tell me this is just around the corner now after all these years of building equity in IP. I need to get back out in the world working and also going to trade shows, maybe working at trade shows? That would kill two birds with one stone. Trade shows are still the place to go and network no matter what the internet thinks so I'm gearing up for some travel but mostly in the US, hopefully by car or train because I like the traveling and flying is really miserable unless it's business class.</p>
    <p>I'm looking for the smallest CNC type machine that can do metal engraving on materials like 430 stainless as well as precious metals and more common ones. I'm going to start with possible aluminum (roughly dog tag size) for POC and early use but eventually I need some decent metals as I'm doing something similar to a cryptowallet which is what I need to go to trade shows to find a supply chain for. If I can find a small CNC or CNC like machine quiet enough to work from home with, at least at first, I'll be in like Flint. Rent out before money in is my idea of a nightmare, in fact fixed monthly rent seems like an outdated concept I should avoid at all costs. I only want real estate when absolutely necessary and all other options are not acceptable. It is IMHO a bad investment. Brick and mortar is expensive and needs to be maximized. I'd like to explore co-use options and other out of the box solutions. I found some success in this when trying to open a kitchen in the past. The deal fell through but I learned a lot about getting a store front and I explored co-use and found receptive owners that were bogged down in rent payments but didn't fully use their real estate 24/7, 365 days a year. A good business here might be matching unused commercial space and time with folks who need temporary commercial space like a commercial kitchen but for various uses depending on what the building is qualified for. Just think, any moment your business real estate is not being used you are bleeding money.</p>
    <p>This is not an issue when money is rolling in but the eighties and nineties are over and we don't know when they are coming back if ever. When 2001 rolled around the party was over and everyone has been trying to start it up every since to no avail. Yeah, we had some fun but the party looks to be officially over. That doesn't mean the show is over. It just means we need to get down to serious business and it's not going to be handed to us. A challenge I am happy with because I was never going to just sit back and take it easy no matter how much money was rolling in.</p>
    <p>I still plan to go back to Fiji to buy more wood vase artwork, that would be a good thing to sell at the trade show. I need a couple of good partners to knock off some of the more simple and fun money makers I have like that one. Shipping now-a-days is no joke, wish I had the time back then when I was in Fiji trying to work a deal, but now I have to learn under fire. I have some samples of the Fijian artwork and the local factory did seem interested, that and I haven't seen this being sold much at all, add in that it is the kind of artwork that is easily salable and in a good price range.</p>
    <p>I have objectives and they aren't to get rich but to have resources to do the things I will accomplish in this life time. This web site is my living CV, and If Now Code LLC is my interface into the world. I am all business in the business of life and it is anything but dull.</p>

    <p>Putting my GitHub website up so I can actually get my business up and running, why not? I have a license. I figured what the heck. I'm kidding, it's taken a lifetime to get here and I still feel like I could use another lifetime to get ready but that is not what we get so here it goes. I've been working on software long enough and more ready then most.</p>
    <p>I have the makings of a visionary software company as well as great ideas for other technical and non technical products. I see digital manufacturing beyond digital products using the same mindset and philosophies. I have a vision of life and how to live in a modern way that leaves behind old out dated notions of how things should be done but keeps the good ways of the past that are tried and true. We are entering a new era and the ways of the past are no longer the best ways to do things. Our life is changing and we need to change with it. I see how we don't need to adapt but how we need to see our evolution and evolve proactively as a natural wonderful process of improvement that makes our lives better on a daily basis. I have a lot of ideas and I hope here they might find a home.</p>
