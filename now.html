    <p>Putting my GitHub website up so I can actually get my business up and running, why not? I have a license. I figured what the heck. I'm kidding, it's taken a lifetime to get here and I still feel like I could use another lifetime to get ready but that is not what we get so here it goes. I've been working on software long enough and more ready then most.</p>
    <p>I have the makings of a visionary software company as well as great ideas for other technical and non technical products. I see digital manufacturing beyond digital products using the same mindset and philosophies. I have a vision of life and how to live in a modern way that leaves behind old out dated notions of how things should be done but keeps the good ways of the past that are tried and true. We are entering a new era and the ways of the past are no longer the best ways to do things. Our life is changing and we need to change with it. I see how we don't need to adapt but how we need to see our evolution and evolve proactively as a natural wonderful process of improvement that makes our lives better on a daily basis. I have a lot of ideas and I hope here they might find a home.</p>
