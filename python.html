  <h3>The Holy Grail</h3>
  <p>I programmed in C/C++ up until a few years ago when after learning Java I descided to take a crack at Python. I found it to be disoncerning at first with it's lack of proper termination but soon saw it as good enforced formatting and fell in love with the quick development, simple extensibily, built in smart data types like dict and list, integrated functional programming, and all the source code out there that makes prototyping and tools tasks as well as small application development simple and easy. Add to that I can extend it in C/C++ and it is the perfect cherry on the top of my programming tool kit.</p> 
  <p>I believe in using the right tool for the job and a programmer should ultimately be language agnostic choosing the correct one for the situation and not just plugging every hole with the language of their choice. Languages are written with puproses in mind and I endevour to learn as many as possible for the sake of learning the underlying principles themselves. I've been studying functional programming lately and am really pleased Python supports this so I can learn and add in functional programming where needed. I don't see the need for pure functional and like the imperitive functional blend but that is just due to the kind of programming I will be doing.</p>
