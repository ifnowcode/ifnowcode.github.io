  <h3>Hello</h3>
  <p>I am currently focused on Windows 10 Security using custom Endpoint Defense and Remediation software in Python using psutil and other libraries. I have and am also working on many tools and technologies over the last few decades and will be sharing them slowly over time as I can roll them out.</p>
  <p>Most of my work is in various development states but I have recently created a solid professional build and file repository environment as I am getting serious about getting my tools and software at least releasable enough for GitHub which does at minimum require some documentation as I'm not just dumping my code up there. Now that I have a robust backup, cloud storage and archival scheme I'm working out the source control and publishing aspects. I am looking forward to collaberating with other developers and sharing my ideas and solutions.</p>
