  <h3>Hello World</h3>
  <p>I am currently focused on Windows 10 Security using custom Endpoint Defense and Remediation software in Python using psutil and other libraries. I have and am also working on many tools and technologies over the last few decades and will be sharing them slowly over time as I can roll them out.</p>
  <p>I am also exploring what I call Virtual Life or VL as a potential salable product for as a mobile game or web application. My early experiments show a lot of potential, are fun and cross over into the unique game niche where interaction is not necessarily necessary and you can watch and observe for entertainment as well as participate if desired. I really like more experimental and open ended programming that has the potential of doing the unexpected and illuminating. My current VL POC is a simple Ferris Beuler toy that with some work could be mistaken for a sleeping very noisy and gaseous person who may or may not be sick. I can't listen to it without smiling and that is what makes it all worth it. My favorite projects are the ones that make me laugh out loud when I think about creating it and smile every time I run (play?) them. I'm an odd gamer, I like games that play themselves so it's a crossover between play and visual entertainment and I'd like to be able to go either direction depending no what the player wants. More open end use that I hope people discover new uses for. For instance VL can just keep a lonely person company, be a game, a live action video and more. It's more life then a tool and can hopefully help fill (not replace) gaps in human social needs.</p>
  <p>Most of my work is in various development states but I have recently created a solid professional build and file repository environment so I can achieve stable builds across various platforms. I am  getting my tools and software at least releasable enough for GitHub which does at minimum require some documentation as I'm not just dumping my code up here. Now that I have a robust backup, cloud storage and archival scheme I'm working out the source control and publishing aspects. I am looking forward to collaborating with other developers and sharing my ideas and solutions.</p>
  <!--<h3>Curated Lists</h3>
  <p><a href="webresources.html">Web Resources</a> These are links by category that I have found be worthy internet. I curate lists on my own intranet and here I will post the choicest bits for the public so they can browse my top internet choices.</p>
