  <h3>Hello</h3>
  <p>I am currently focused on Windows 10 Security using custom Endpoint Defense and Remediation software in Python using psutil and other libraries. I have and am also working on many tools and technologies over the last few decades and will be sharing them slowly over time as I can roll them out.</p>
  <p>Most of my work is in various development states but I have recently created a solid professional build and file repository environment so I can achieve stable builds across various platforms. I am  getting my tools and software at least releasable enough for GitHub which does at minimum require some documentation as I'm not just dumping my code up here. Now that I have a robust backup, cloud storage and archival scheme I'm working out the source control and publishing aspects. I am looking forward to collaborating with other developers and sharing my ideas and solutions.</p>
