  <h3>Hello</h3>
  <p>I am currently focused on Windows 10 Security using custom Endpoing Detection and Remediation software in Python using psutil and other libries. I have and am also working on many tools and technolgies over the last few decades and will be sharing them slowly over time as I can roll them out. Most of my work in in various development states but I have recently created a solid professional build and file repository enviromment and am getting serious about getting my tools and software at least releasable enough for GitHub which does at minimum require some documentation as I'm not just dumping my code up here. I already have a robust backup, cloud storage and archival scheme but having my most precious code on GitHub will be even more secure.</p>
